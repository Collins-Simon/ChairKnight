```
The game loop is enter a room, kill enemies (by launching yourself with the grappling hook or throwing bombs), pick up health and coins, then move to the next room.
It is a roguelike similar to Enter the Gungeon or Binding of Isaac, but a grappling hook is your main weapon.
The aim is to collect the most coins by defeating as many enemies as you can before dying.
